function words = splitter(string, delimiter)
% Inputs:
% - string    - The string that will be broken into chunks of words
% - delimiter - Where to split the sentence at (not necessarily space)
%             - Bonus only, fine if you can't do it
%
% Outputs:
% - words     - the words obtained from splitting the string

%% Splitting
% honestly you can just refer to help split
% BONUS if you can figure out how to use unique delimiter 
% to better stylize our results
% like for example, splitting at where ' // ' appears on the string

% IT'S NOT FINAL IF WE ARE PLANNING ON USING THIS AS A SEPARATE FUNCTION
% THAT'S TO BE DECIDED ON LATER ON
