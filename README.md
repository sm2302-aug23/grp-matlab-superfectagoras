## Task  1: Readying the letters
### 1.1: Observations on cursive fonts and handwriting
During brainstorming, we thought of using the Pacifico Font. But after several more discussion, we decided to use Waqi's sister cursive font as reference to the fonts that we plot using spline. Below is how the cursive font looks like for both uppercase and lowercase letters;

![uppercase reference](https://github.com/sm2302-aug23/grp-matlab-superfectagoras/blob/main/uppercase%20reference.jpeg)

Here's how some of the plots we made looks like;


### 1.2: Observation on splines
- Start and end of curves
- Sharp turns
- Back-and-forths

### 1.3: Applying the observations
- Standardizing the size
- Selection of points
- Consistent starting and ending points
- Handling sharp corners

## Task 2: Creating letter_database.m
- Purpose: To store the coordinates of each letters
- Methodology: Dictionary
- Error Handling
- The file is [letters_database.m](letters_database.m) for reference

## Task 3: Making words/sentences
- Translating the coordinates to the right
- Breaking lines by shifting coordinates to the top/bottom
- Adjusting the axes to clearly show the plot
- The code can be viewed in [translator.m](translator.m) for reference

## Task 4: Creating plotWord.m
- Breaking strings into chunks of words
- Breaking chunks of words into characters
- The file is [plotWord.m](plotWord.m) for reference

## Bonus Tasks: Aesthetic Bonuses
- Changing the line colour and thickness
- The file is [ThickColour.m](ThickColour.m) for reference
- Advanced Line Breaking System
- Animating the plot
